    <h1>Hay Man La Min</h1>
    <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Hay Man La Min. I am from <mark>Myanmar</mark>.If you do not know where Myanmar is, no worries. Myanmar is one of the Southeast Asia countries and it is bordered with Thailand and China. I finished my high school in the City of <mark>Yangon</mark> in Myanmar. And then I served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for one year and six months in the land of smile, <mark>Thailand</mark>. After finished serving my mission, I went back to my home country and worked as a Korean language teacher for a few months.Now I am studying in the Brigham University-Hawaii.

    <p>When talking about myself, it is impossible not to talk about <strong>K dramas and K variety shows</strong>. I enjoy watching them alot. As I am the only child, I had to spend most of my times alone. Television was my best friend. Everynight after our shop was closed, my grandmother and me watched K dramas together. Those memories were unforgettable.Those memories helped me to learn Korean language and build my interest in making <strong>YouTube videos</strong> and <em>I  made my first ever video last Saturday.</em>
    <br><ol type="A">Things I adore in God's creation:
        <li>Songs of birds</li>
        <li>Paws of cats</li>
        <li>Scent of breeze</li>
    </ol>
