        <p>1.What you learned about Flex and CSS</p>
        <p>In flex, parent allows children to choose their size and it also helps our pages to be flexiable and aligned with any size of screens. </p>
        <p>2. Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</p>
        <p>We need to have an accessible website because it is a sensitive legal case here in Amarica and it can have every person to be able to use our websites. It means having accommodations for people with some kinds of disabilities to be able get a chance of using our websites like others do.</p>
