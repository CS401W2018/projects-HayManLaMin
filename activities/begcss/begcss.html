        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p>I am listening how websites became devoloped in the class today.
            The most important thing in CSS is HTML Attributes or tags. 
            But those are very old and we do not use it anymore. 
            We will use Inline CSS here. But if we use Inline CSS, we will lose our points.
            The next level is embeddied CSS. Selecter allows us to choose where we want to apply style tag.
            And we will not use it in our projects too. The next one is External CSS.
        </p>
        <h3>1.Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</h3>
        <p>Inline is used by putting directly together with element and it used as the systle attribute.
            Embedded is used by writting in the HTML head as style tag.
            External is used by creating and saving in a seperate file and linking in the head of HTML.
        </p>
       <h3>2. Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h3> 
       <P>
        We should only use external CSS because that way we are restricting Web Designers to create design on our web pages
        and if we use other CSS in our projects, we will lose our points.</P>
        <h3>3. What is a selector used for?</h3>
        <p>The selector is used for choosing tag where we want to apply our CSS.</p>
